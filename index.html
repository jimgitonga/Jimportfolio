Detail-Oriented Bio-Medical Engineer/Software Developer with 1.5 years of experience in small software design for my projects (hardware based) and helping final year engineering students program their projects and test them. Also
competed in African Biomedical Design Consortium (ABEC) in 2019 and emerged the best with the best medical model.Also, after finishing my form four I was called back to my former high school to be a peer teacher for 6 months. And am a
self-taught programmer with high thirst for knowledge. For last 3yrs I have learnt C, Python and JavaScript (MERNSTACK+ HTML5 REACT&REACTNATIVE). When Covid19 came I was called back by the university to aid in design
of a ventilator. I and my colleagues designed and built it from the scratch in 3 months’ time.

                <p>
                    • Developed an EMR (Electrical medical record) mobile application.
                    • Implemented fully Nodejs back-end server to route services.
                    • Implemented patient data safety by use of patient power to authorized the
                    doctor to access previous medical information.
                    • Encrypted patient data for data safety.
                    • The application is still in developed where we are implementing an analytic
                    system.

                    • Designed Flence Ventilator when Covid19 hit.
                    • Programmed the micro-controller and uploaded the Firmware to run the ventilator
                    machine. With following parameters:
                    1. Implemented tidal volume 200-700mL.
                    2. Controlled breath rate to 40 breaths per minute.
                    3. Implemented PEEP pressure to 5-20cm H2O.
                    4. Maintained inspiration expiration rate I: E 1:1-1:4.
                    5. Created two modes of operation which are Adults and Neonatal.
                    6. Included FiO2 sensor to measure Oxygen 30%-100%.
                    7. The ventilator can be accessed in technical university of Mombasa Medical
                    Engineering department.
                    • Developed a machine learning Software that could classify Covid19 images from
                    Computed Tomography (CT) and distinguish them from pneumonia and normal
                    images. The algorithm had 94% accuracy
                    8. Developed heat-maps to show the doctor why the software classified the image in a
                    particular way. And deployed the software also to the cloud using momenta NGROK
                    SERVER
